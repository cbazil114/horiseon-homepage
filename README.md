# horiseon-homepage

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to refactor the starter code provided with the Module 1 assignment. The objective of the webpage is to follow accessibility standards and streamlined code without affecting the overall visualization of the page. 

No installation required.

## User Story

* **AS A** marketing agency
* **I WANT** a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* **SO THAT** our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

* **GIVEN** a webpage meets accessibility standards
* **WHEN** I view the source code
* **THEN** I find semantic HTML elements
* **WHEN** I view the structure of the HTML elements
* **THEN** I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* **WHEN** I view the icon and image elements
* **THEN** I find accessible alt attributes
* **WHEN** I view the heading attributes
* **THEN** they fall in sequential order
* **WHEN** I view the title element
* **THEN** I find a concise, descriptive title

## Assignment Completion

To complete the assignment, only minor changes are required. 

In order of the acceptance criteria,
* For the accessibility standards, I added alt text to all of the images and made the changes to the HTML elements to become semantic. However, I could not find a semantic equivalent to a few elements, including the div class="hero" image. I spoke with multiple AskBCS learning assistants, and they all said it should not be changed, but they could not explain it.
* Structurally, I don't see much of an issue. The different sections were all in the right place, albeit they needed to change to a semantic equivalent. 
* The image and icon elements are interesting. I added the alt marker to all the images, but I cannot see them; when I hover over them in the webpage it does not appear. However, they appear in the DevTools, and a learning assistant says that is all I need. I was also told I did not need it for the "hero" image, which is confusing since it is an image element, but I removed it just in case. 
* Similar to the HTML structure, I did not see anything particularly wrong with the heading attributes. The header usage seems sufficient when 1, 2, and 3 are used, respectively. 
* I changed the title to reflect the information in the footer, as it would be the homepage for marketing agency Horiseon.

Lastly, I condensed many categories under new classes, such as "benefits" and "content." That way, the stylesheet, and index.html became muchless clunky and streamlined much of the coding.
